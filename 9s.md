# Figure out the product of 9 x Whatever

To figure this out, you need to do this. (Variables are defined later)

- The first few digit(s) of the number are the number you're multiplying 9 by, minus m.
- The last digit(s) of the number are 10 minus the **ONES PLACE** of the number you're multiplying 9 by.
For example, for 2, it would be 10 - 2, and that is exactly the same for 12.

The reason _m_ is a variable is because 9 will not always get a unique tens digit. 99 and 90, for example, are both products of 9 x 11 and 9 x 10, respectively.
When a duplicate tens digit appears, you must add 1 to _m_, it starts at 1.

Let's test this on a few numbers!

- **9 x 2**:
- - The first digit of the number is 2 minus 1.
- - The last digit of the number is 10 minus 2.
- - Therefore, it's 18.
- **1 x 9**:
- - The first digit of the number is 1 minus 1.
- - The last digit of the number is 10 minus 1.
- - Therefore, it's 09.
- Let's get a bit more complicated.
- **9 x 15**:
- - The first digit(s) of the number are 15 minus 2 (remember: 90 and 99 are duplicate tens, so we added 1 to _m_!)
- - The last digit(s) of the number are 10 minus 5. (remember: the **ONES DIGIT** is used!)
- - Therefore, it's 135!
